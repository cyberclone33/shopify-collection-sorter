# Loading Implementation for Daily Discounts Page

Here's a summary of the changes we've made and what needs to be added to complete the implementation:

## Changes Already Made

1. **Modified the loader in `app.daily-discounts.tsx`**:
   - Updated to return quickly with essential data
   - Removed the slow `getRandomProducts` call from server-side
   - Added flags to indicate client-side loading is needed
   - Returns minimal data needed for initial render

2. **Added client-side loading logic in `app.daily-discounts.tsx`**:
   - Added state variables to track loading progress and products
   - Created a useEffect hook to fetch product data after initial render
   - Implemented loading progress updates

3. **Created a `LoadingOverlay` component**:
   - Visual indicator with progress bar
   - Error handling
   - Retry functionality

4. **Created an API endpoint for loading products**:
   - Added `api.random-products.tsx` for client-side fetching

## Remaining Steps

1. **Insert the LoadingOverlay component**:
   - The LoadingOverlay component should be added near the top of the page content
   - It should be visible when `loadingRandomProducts` is true
   - Use the code: `<LoadingOverlay progress={loadingProgress} isLoading={loadingRandomProducts} error={loadingError} />`

2. **Handle empty product state**:
   - When `multipleRandomProducts.length === 0` and `!loadingRandomProducts`, show a message

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify the page loads quickly
   - Confirm loading indicator displays while products load
   - Ensure products are displayed correctly when loaded

## Usage Instructions

1. The page will now load immediately without waiting for product data
2. A loading indicator will display while product data is being fetched
3. Once data is loaded, the loading indicator will disappear and products will be shown

This implementation improves user experience by making the page responsive while heavy data loading happens in the background.
